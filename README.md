## Description

This project was created for the Reddit Client project from Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Career Path.
It fetches the posts' data of selected Subreddits using the Reddit JSON API and displays it.
The user is able to select which Subreddit they want to see, filter the posts using the search bar and see the posts' comments.
There is an upvote and downvote UI, but they are only visual.
This project was made using React and Redux Toolkit.
It uses Jest for testing some of its functions.
This website is responsive and uses aria-labels for accessibility.
It also contains a few CSS on hover events for more interactivity.
